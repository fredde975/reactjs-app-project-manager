# Asset folder

This folder should contain sources / originals for all assets used in the distribution.

Images, logos, fonts etc are intended to "live" here.

Most of the assets will simply be copied to the dist at build time - the exception being assets that is assembled from other sources (image variants, pre-compiled libs ets)
